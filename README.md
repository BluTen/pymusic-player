# CMD Music Player
A command line music player.

Just run main.py and a music will start The only thing this peice of code can do(For Now) is pause, play and rewind it. The way you can do that is available when you run the software ;-)

> Note: I tested it on VSC Intergreted Terminal(it works like a charm), Windows Command Line Interface and PowerShell(On my pc these two places were the ui looks a little buggy)
